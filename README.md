## Requirements
The client has requested an online store that enables them to sell goods and services worldwide, similar to Amazon but on a smaller scale and budget. They prefer the system to be built in Java and integrated with their existing network. The system should have a customer interface for browsing products, viewing descriptions and prices, adding items to the shopping cart, and purchasing them. If the customer attempts to order more items than available, the system should prevent the purchase and display an availability message. The system should also have an administrator interface for updating product descriptions, prices, and quantities, as well as adding or removing items and managing customer accounts. The administrators should be able to add or remove other administrators and customer accounts. The system should allow customers to register their accounts by themselves. It should also handle errors and unexpected situations gracefully, remain reliable, and handle multiple customer requests simultaneously.

## Specific actions/events that should be handled as part of the system:
    Users/Administrators Login & Registration
    Browsing Items
    Updating Items
    Removing Items
    Adding Items
    Purchasing Items
